# BicycleOrm

Bicycle reinvented.

Tiny gem that demonstrating simple ORM realizaition.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bicycle_orm'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bicycle_orm

## Usage

Best way to check out this gem is to start tests:

    $ rake

I wonder if it will be used in production, so passing tests are quite enough for this gem.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment. Run `bundle exec bicycle_orm` to use the code located in this directory, ignoring other installed copies of this gem.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
